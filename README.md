# Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) - Overview

This repository explores Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) applied to audio signals. In the same way that Digital Signal Processing (DSP) refers to algorithmic techniques for manipulating digital audio, Quantum Signal Processing refers to the use of quantum computing algorithms to process audio signals encoded as quantum states.

## Workflow

1. Load an audio signal  
2. Encode the signal using a quantum audio encoding scheme  
3. Apply quantum signal processing operations  
4. Decode the quantum state back into an audio signal  
5. Analyse or listen to the resulting output

## Requirements

- Python Python 3.13.5 
- Qiskit 1.4.1  
- Quantum Audio Package (QAP)
